        <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. Examples are: python, ruby, jupiter,java, JavaScript, C, C++, and C#. Programming languages are used to write all computer software. A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something.

        A programmer writes text in the source code of a programming language to make programs. Usually, the programming language uses real words for some of the commands (e.g. "go to", "if... then... else...", etc.), so that the language is easier for a human to understand. Like any normal language, many programming languages use punctuation. Many programs are then compiled, which means that the computer changes, or translates, the source code into another language (such as assembly language or machine language) that a computer can read, but which is much harder for a person to read.
        
        Computer programs must be written very carefully. If a programmer makes mistakes, or a program tries to do something the programmer did not design it to do, then the program might then stop working, which is called "crashing". When a program has a problem because of how the code was written, this is called a "bug". A very small mistake can cause a very big problem</p>
